### Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model \(EMRAM\)

The HIMSS Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model \(EMRAM\) is used to assess EMR implementation and adoption of the technology for hospitals and health systems globally, guiding the data-driven advancement of care in a health systemâ€™s acute or inpatient care facilities through EMR technology.

With the EMRAM, optimize your EMR implementation to improve patient care and safety. Leveraging information digitally improves patient safety and satisfaction by reducing errors in care, length of stay for patients and duplicated care orders, among other things. Organizations can use the EMRAM to improve person-enabled [health and governance and workforce dimensions of digital health in the acute care setting](https://www.himss.org/what-we-do-solutions/digital-health-transformation).
